In **Abricotine**, you can preview your document directly in the text editor rather than in a side pane.

**Abricotine** is an [open-source software](LICENSE) based on modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3 & Node.js). It is available on Windows (7 and +), Linux and OS X.

## Features

* Preview text elements (such as headers, images, math, embedded videos, todo lists...) while you type,
* Use different themes to display your documents,
* Use custom postprocessors to export your documents ("tasks"),
* Auto save your document on change (optional),
* Display document table of content in the side pane,
* Display syntax highlighting for code,
* Show helpers, anchors and hidden characters,
* Copy formatted HTML in the clipboard,
* Write in a distraction-free fullscreen view,
* Manage and beautify markdown tables,
* Search and replace text,
* Ligatures support ([Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) must be installed on your computer),
* And more features to come...
